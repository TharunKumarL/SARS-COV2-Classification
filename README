In Dataset We firstly Collected 5 types of protein sequences including sars covid 
sars cov 2 labelled as 1
and rest labelled as 2

sars-cov2 - 10841
sars-cov - 35
hcov-oc43 - 2913
mers-cov - 3609
Human coronavirus 229E - 1107

Now I created Adjacency Matrix and Feautre Matrix for each sequence 
And Performed Graph Convolution Network (according to gcn.png)
created feaute vector for each sequence stored in protein_feautres.npy  (gcn.py)

Now I classified the feautre vectors into two classes using k means clustering (clustering_labels.py)

validate is for perform validation (validate.py)
